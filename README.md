## System Architecture

### NLP Pipeline
1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Tokenization (NLTK)
   - Stopword removal
   - Lowercasing & punctuation removal
2. **Feature Extraction**
   - TF-IDF Vectorization
   - Word Embeddings (Word2Vec via Gensim)
3. **Similarity Matching**
   - Cosine similarity to find most relevant answer
4. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Naive Bayes
   - Logistic Regression
   - GRU-based neural network (Keras/TensorFlow)
5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
